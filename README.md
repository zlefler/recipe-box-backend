## Recipe Box

Recipe box is a small web app that allows you to create recipes, and save other people's recipes that also use the app. [Short walkthrough here.](https://youtu.be/v6Ow_3k0_sE)

## Installation

If you want to run your own copy of it on a home server, you will need npm and bundle installed on your machine.
Clone the repo, cd into the folder, then run `npm i --prefix client` and `bundle i`.

You can also use the deployed version of the app [here.](https://sheltered-beach-55238.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage

To create the database from your computer, type `rails db:create db:migrate`. If you want to use the seed files, add `db:create` to the previous command.
To start the server, type `rails s`. Then, in a separate terminal, type `npm start --prefix client`. This should automatically navigate you to http://localhost:3000 , where you can use the app.

Usage of the app is fairly straightfoward: You can sign up for an account, create recipes, save other people's recipes. You can edit and delete your own recipes, but not others.
